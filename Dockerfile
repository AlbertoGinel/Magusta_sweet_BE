2. Port Mismatch

    Problem: Render may expect your service to run on a specific port (often 10000 for HTTP by default), but if your Tomcat server is configured for another port, Render might not connect properly, leading to repeated connection attempts and EOFException.
    Solution: Confirm that Tomcat is set to listen on the correct port. In your Dockerfile or docker-compose.yml, make sure the correct port (e.g., 8080 if you specified it) is both exposed and mapped to Renderâ€™s expected port.
